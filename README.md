4. Get Orders with Filters
GET /api/v1/orders

Query Parameters:

address (optional)
productId (optional)
orderedOn (optional, format: YYYY-MM-DD)
userId (optional)
Response:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "orderID": "12345",
    "productId": "P001",
    "orderedOn": "2024-10-16T12:00:00Z",
    "userId": "5f8f8c30b2c5b9d2837acbbf"
  },

]
Response Status:

200 OK on success
400 Bad Request if invalid filter is provided
404 Not Found if no orders match the filters
500 Internal Server Error if server error occurs
Description: This endpoint allows fetching orders based on various filters (address, productId, orderedOn, and userId). The results are returned in a JSON array, which is rendered as a data table on the frontend.

Database
The backend uses MongoDB to store data:

Users: User details including name, address, phone number, and email.
Orders: Orders with associated products, order IDs, user IDs, and timestamps.
Products: Product information including product IDs, names, and prices.
Database Setup
Install MongoDB locally or use a MongoDB cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Configure your connection string in .env file as:
bash
Copy code
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database
Frontend (React.js)
The frontend uses React.js to interact with the backend APIs. The main components are:

User Creation Form: Form to add a new user.
Order Creation Form: Form to add a new order.
Product Creation Form: Form to add a new product.
Order List: Displays the list of orders in a data table, with the ability to filter based on parameters such as address, productId, orderedOn, and userId.
How to Run
Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
# For Backend
cd backend
npm install

# For Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
The backend will be running on http://localhost:5000 and the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Error Handling
Common Errors:
403 Forbidden: The user does not have permission to access the requested resource.
404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.
500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
These errors are handled gracefully by returning an appropriate HTTP status code along with an error message.

Testing
For API testing, tools like Postman or Insomnia can be used to test the endpoints.

Create User: POST /api/v1/user
Create Order: POST /api/v1/order
Create Product: POST /api/v1/product
Get Orders: GET /api/v1/orders?address=...
Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Frontend: React.js
Database: MongoDB
API Format: REST
Conclusion
This project implements a user, order, and product management system with a simple frontend interface and a backend REST API. You can insert users, orders, and products into the system, retrieve orders with multiple filters, and display them in a frontend data table.
